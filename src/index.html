    <!--
        I didn't use AI when making this, that's why it works at least some of
        the time. It was absolutely useless trying to get help with getting this
        shit working, I was so pissed lmao. Two hours wasted.

        <h1>Vintage Restoration Image Watermarker</h1>
        <p>How to use:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Tap the button beneath <strong>Select Images</strong> heading
                and select all of the images you would like to add the watermark
                onto.
            </li>
            <li>
                The images currently being processed will be shown beneath the
                <strong>Working On...</strong> heading. Once there are no image
                names shown there, the process is complete.
            </li>
            <li>
                To save the watermarked images, tap and hold each image under
                the <strong>Finished Images</strong> heading until the context
                menu opens, then select save to photos.
            </li>
        </ol>
